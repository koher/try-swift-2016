# Three Stories about Error Handling in Swift

This repository contains the slides and the transcript of my talk in [try! Swift 2016](http://www.tryswiftconf.com/en). The video of my talk is available [here](https://realm.io/news/tryswift-yuta-koshizawa-error-handling-swift/).  

## Notice

My talk is a kind of parody of [Jobs' speech](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html).

## How to open the slides

Open [slides.md](slides.md) by [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/).

Chose the theme "Plain Jane" and white color.

## Where is the transcript?

The Markdown file includes the transcript of my talk. Lines started by `^` are the ones.

They can be also shown in the rehearsal mode by DeckSet.
